<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>
    On each of the following pages, you will see a multiple-choice question.
    You will see a pattern of 5 pictures.
    Your task is to complete this sequence. To do this, you must choose which of the 5 options given
    below the sequence completes the pattern. <br>
</p>
<h4> Score and Payment: </h4>
<p>
    The test consists of {{C.Q_NUM_LOGIC}} questions.
    You have {{ C.TIME_PER_QUESTION }} seconds to answer each question.
    You receive one point for each correct answer. There is no penalty for incorrect answers.

    The bonus payment is based on your score,
    i.e. the number of questions you answer correctly.
    You receive <b>${{C.BONUS_LOGIC}} for each correct answer</b> - if this block is drawn as the block-that-counts.
    So you can receive up to ${{C.MAX_BONUS_LOGIC}},
    based on the number of questions and therefore a maximum score of {{C.Q_NUM_LOGIC}} points.
</p>


<h4>Example:</h4>
<div>
    <img src="{{ static 'global/inductive_13.jpg' }}"
         width="500px"
         class="annotatable"/>
</div> <br>
<p>
    Here, the correct answer is {{C.EXAMPLE_SOLUTION}}.
    </p>
<p>
    <b> Explanation: </b>
    From one picture to the next, the black square moves one step down and jumps to the top of the next column if
    it reaches the bottom of the current column. The black dot moves one step to the right and jumps to the left side
    of the next row if it reaches the right side of the current row.
