<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>
    On each of the following pages, you will see a matrix with arrows pointing in different directions.
    Your task is to count the number of arrows that point to the right (<span style="font-size:20px"><b>â†’</b></span>).
</p>
<h4> Score</h4>
<p>
    You have <b>{{ C.TIME_EFFORT_MIN }} minutes</b> to solve as many matrices as possible.
    You receive one point for each correct answer, thus correctly counted
    number of arrows that point to the right.
    <!-- The bonus payment is based on your score.
    You receive <b>${{C.BONUS_EFFORT}}</b> for each correct answer. -->
</p>

<p>
    Please click on "Next" when you have understood the instructions and are ready to start the task.
    You will then see the first matrix and the {{ C.TIME_EFFORT_MIN }} minutes timer will start.
