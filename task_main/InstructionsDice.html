<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<p>
    On the following page, you will be asked to roll a die {{C.DICE_ROLLS}} times.
</p>
<h4> Score and Payment: </h4>
<p>
    The die is a fair dice with equal probability of rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Thus, what you roll is completely random
    and you have no influence on the outcome. <br>

    You can receive a bonus payment for this game which depends on your score.

    You receive {{C.POINTS_SIX}} points for each 6 you roll and {{C.POINTS_FIVE}} point for each 5 you roll.
    <b>Each point is then converted into a payment of ${{C.BONUS_DICE}}</b>.
    This means that you earn ${{C.BONUS_SIX}} for every 6 you roll and ${{C.BONUS_FIVE}} for every 5 you roll - if
    this block is drawn as the block-that-counts.
</p>

<p>
    Please click on "Next" when you have understood the instructions and are ready to start the game.
